# 🌾 SmartKrishi  
### Smart Krishi is a production-grade, edge-first smart agriculture system that automates irrigation and farm monitoring using IoT, long-range LoRa networking, and AI-driven decision intelligence.
Unlike typical cloud-dependent agri-IoT projects, Smart Krishi runs critical irrigation logic locally on-field, ensuring zero downtime, low latency, and reliability even with poor or no internet connectivity. The cloud is used for intelligence, not survival.
🚀 What Makes Smart Krishi Different
Edge-First Automation
Irrigation decisions execute locally on ESP32 nodes. No internet, no server dependency, no crop risk.
Multi-Node, Farm-Scale Architecture
Dedicated soil nodes, irrigation nodes, industrial sensor nodes, and a gateway designed for real deployments, not demos.
Long-Range, Low-Power Communication
LoRa-based networking enables kilometer-scale coverage with minimal power consumption.
Actionable Data, Not Just Dashboards
Sensors drive real actions like pump and valve control, not just charts.
AI for Optimization (in progress)
Models trained on farm-specific data to predict irrigation needs, detect anomalies, and reduce resource waste.
🧠 Core Capabilities
Real-time soil and environmental monitoring
Automated pump and solenoid valve control
Local fail-safe irrigation logic
GSM-based cloud sync with local SD logging
Scalable hardware and firmware design
🎯 Impact
Up to 30–40% water savings through precise irrigation
Reduced manual labor and human error
Higher yield consistency via data-backed decisions
Designed for small farmers and scalable to commercial farms
🧩 Vision
Smart Krishi is evolving into a full-stack agri-tech platform combining:
Precision farming automation
