# Problem Analysis – SmartKrishi

## Background
Agriculture remains the backbone of India’s economy, yet a large percentage of farmers still rely on
traditional knowledge, delayed expert advice, and guesswork for crop management.

Small and marginal farmers face difficulties such as:
- Late detection of crop diseases
- Unpredictable weather conditions
- Lack of access to agricultural experts
- Limited digital tools tailored for rural users

## Core Problems Identified
1. Crop diseases are identified too late, leading to heavy yield loss.
2. Farmers lack real-time, localized advisories.
3. Existing agriculture apps are complex and not farmer-friendly.
4. Communication barriers (language & literacy) reduce technology adoption.

## Target Users
- Small and marginal farmers
- Rural agricultural workers
- First-time smartphone users in farming communities

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- Most apps provide generic information
- No AI-powered image-based disease detection
- Poor UX for low-literacy users
- Lack of integrated dashboard for farmers

## Problem Statement
“How can we empower farmers with an easy-to-use, AI-driven platform that provides real-time,
actionable agricultural insights and disease detection?”

## Planning Insight from Kiro
Using Kiro IDE, we broke down the problem into manageable domains:
- Disease detection
- Advisory & decision support
- Accessibility & simplicity
- Trust and accuracy

This structured thinking guided all further development decisions.
